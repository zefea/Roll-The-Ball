# Roll-The-Ball
This program is a javafx project. To run it, firstly javafx library should be download.  


Problem Definition :
This game aims moving a ball from a start point to an end point if there is an appropriate path. The player must create a path using pipes given as sliding tiles. There are several levels. Default level is 5. But it can be set as different number of levels. 

To play the game, player must choose a tile, drag it into somewhere and drop it. But there are some rules for sliding tiles and playing the next level.
Here are the rules: 
- Player can move the pipes by using only mouse. Keys on the computer are useless.
- Player can move the pipes only to free spaces which is colored grey. 
- Player can only move non-static pipes (red and blue pipes is static).
- The blue pipe that starts in the middle of a tile and has a ball on it, is start point. And the red one is end point.
- Player can move pipes only one tile distance vertically or horizontally. 
- If the appropriate path appears, then the ball falls from starter to end point. 
- Once the ball falls and complete that level, player will be able to play the next level.
- There is no limit for playerâ€™s moves. 

If all levels are passed one by one, pane will disappear, and then player will understand that the game is finished with a message and a song.
